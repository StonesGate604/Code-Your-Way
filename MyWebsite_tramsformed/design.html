					<p class="design--1">In this fast-paced era, new products come out all the time, but at the same time, people still have strong feelings for old objects and the stories behind those old objects. This nostalgia is not only for the objects themselves, but also for the memories associated with them. These memories often carry personal emotions and traces of history, and are valuable assets that people want to preserve. Therefore, we initiated this project with the aim of finding an innovative way to fulfill this need to preserve the past and cherish memories.</p>
