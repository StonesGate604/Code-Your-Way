					<h1>Hello,<br>I am Zekai Wang.</h1>
					<p>I graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University, jointly founded by Xi'an Jiaotong University and the University of Liverpool, majoring in Industrial Design and obtained an Bachelor of Engineering degree with honours. I hope to further my studies in the fields of integrated design and interaction design.</p>
					<p>I am passionate about using innovative interaction methods and tangible interaction (tactile feedback) to enhance the user experience. At the same time, I am also very interested in the practical application of advanced human-computer interaction technology in entertainment.</p>
